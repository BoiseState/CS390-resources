Six samples of resumes from CS students. These have all received favorable reactions from
industry in terms of format and layout. Several of these  were made using the Overleaf website,
which is free to use.

Please note that we changed the names and contact information to preserve privacy but in the process
the fonts changed. The original resumes looked a bit better but you will get the idea what it should
look like :-)
